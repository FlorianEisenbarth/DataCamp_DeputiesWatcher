## RAMP Challenge: French deputies votes prediction

Authors: *Florian Eisenbarth, Nicolas Oulianov, Nicolas Boussenina, Armand Foucault, Eloi Alardet*

This class group project is about predicting positions of deputies on votes in the French National Assembly.

We collect data from the government and heavily process it to build a custom supervized dataset. 

We analyze this dataset to highlight *political games* inside the National Assembly.

Finally, using a Deep Learning model and smart feature engineering, we predict voting positions of a set of 10 political groups. We reach an accuracy of roughly 75%. We create a custom metric, a weighted F1 score tuned to our problem, that scores about 72% (best being 100%).
